Tracking Global Sea Temperatures Between 1972 & 2013

Part 1. Hypothesis Testing:

Was there a statistically significant change in average sea temperature
measured at a max depth of 7682m between the years of 1972 and 2013?

Null: There was no statistically significant change in sea temperature between 1972 & 2013

Alternative: There was a statistically significant change in sea temperature between 1972 & 2013

Test type: Welch's two-tailed t-test
Alpha: 0.05
Significance Level = 0.025

Part 2. Predictive Modeling

If time permits, I will do some regression analysis (Elastic Net?) and
create a predictive model targeting 'temperature'.
